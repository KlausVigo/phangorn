    CHANGES in PHANGORN VERSION 3.0.0

NEW FEATURES

    o as.networx and plot.networx got a new option "outline", reducing the

      number of edges plotted

OTHER CHANGES

    o improvements to write.ancestral and write.pml.

    o update.pml can now also update site.rate.

    o NNI rearrangements in optim.pml / pml_bb are faster for larger trees.

    o bab got a progress bar, as it might runs for a long time (suggested by

      Barbara Bitarello). bab might be faster thanks to improved lower bound.

    o densiTree now calls axisPhylo, which was improved in ape, to avoid code

      duplication

    o more error checking of input arguments and associated tests


    CHANGES in PHANGORN VERSION 2.12.0

NEW FEATURES

    o new function supgma, performing serial sampled UPGMA

      (Drummond, Rodrigo 2000)

    o new function gap_as_state, treating gaps as a state.

    o new function keep_as_tip allows to prune a tree and keep nodes as a tip

      (suggested by Hedvig Skirgard)

    o nnls now can estimate trees with calibrations and tip dated trees

    o the functions Descendants, Ancestors, Siblings, mrca.phy now also accept a

      character vector for the node argument and not only integers.

    o Ancestral state reconstruction was rewritten.

      The output of ancestral.pars and ancestral.pars could return different

      objects. anc_pml and anc_pars are now prefered over ancestral.pml and

      ancestral.pars. Output is now an object of class ancestral, which contains

      tree with node labels, the original alignment and reconstructions.

      The should be considered experimental as the internals of this function

      might change in future.

      Ancestral states of constant sites are now always this state.

    o Joint reconstruction for ML is now available.

    o Improvements to several plot functions to get nicer plots out of the box.

      Nicer defaults for plot.pml, mainly for rooted trees.

    o plotAnc got an argument scheme allowing to use different color schemes,

      especially for amino acid models shared with image.AAbin and assumes an

      ancestral object.

    o plot.networx gets two additional arguments, direction as in plot.phylo and

      angle to rotate the network.

    o new function composition_test, indicating possible problems with base /

      state composition, similar to the test in iqtree.

OTHER CHANGES

    o pml.control got an argument statefreq, which controls if "empirical"

      or (ML) "estimated" state/base frequencies are used/computed. The change

      of the default to "empirical" speeds up functions modelTest and

      pml_bb/optim.pml. However estimates will differ to previous versions,

      which were implicitly using "estimated".

    o some improvements to pmlPart.

    o the sankoff algorithm has been rewritten.

BUG FIXES

    o pml_bb roots the tree, if method is either ultrametric or tipdated. Fixes

      problem when modelTest object was supplied.

    o nnls.tree now checks if the tree has singletons.

NEW FEATURES

    o several improvements to simplify workflow and flatten learning curve.

    o new function pml_bb, combining generation of starting trees, pml and

      optim.pml and allowing modelTest object as input.

    o tipdated phylogenies estimation (was with limitations possible before,

      but not documented).

    o Mkv model, edge length and rearrangements only work for ultrametric and

      tiplabeled phylogenies so far.

    o Added experimental version of RELL bootstrap (Minh et al. 2013 Ultrafast

      Approximation for Phylogenetic Bootstrap).

    o modelTest now tests several models for USER defined data.

OTHER CHANGES

    o bug in dna2codon fixed.

    o codon models (codonTest) most likely did not work properly for models

      other than the standard code.

NEW FEATURES

     o pratchet, optim.parsimony, optim.pml all may now return trees with

       lead to speeding up computations and improved tree topology search.

     o function codonTest which adds codon models to detect positive selection

       (M1a, M2a) and several options to estimate codon frequencies

      (thanks to Emmanuel and Liat)



        CHANGES in PHANGORN VERSION 1.0-1


NEW FEATURES

    o ancestral sequence reconstruction

      (parsimony and likelihood based)

    o a small convenience function acgt2ry for ry-coding

    o as.phylo.splits computes a tree from compatible splits

BUG FIXES

    o a small error in pmlCluster was fixed

OTHER CHANGES

    o upgma changed to accommodate change in as.phylo.hclust

    o lento plots are looking nicer




	CHANGES IN PHANGORN VERSION 1.0-0


NEW FEATURES

    o implementation of many nucleotide substitution models

      (additional general transition models can be defined)

    o new function modelTest, comparison of different phylogenetic model

      with AIC or BIC

    o Lento plot

    o subset functions for phyDat objects

BUG FIXES

    o an error in pace is fixed

OTHER CHANGES

    o parsimony (fitch and sankoff) can now handle multiPhylo objects

    o splits structure (which is a list of bipartitions), used by lento

      and hadamard conjugation

    o phyDat objects can be more general generated using a contrast

      matrix



        CHANGES IN PHANGORN VERSION 0.99-6


NEW FEATURES

    o pace, extracts the ancestral states of the root of a tree

      using the sankoff algorithm

BUG FIXES

    o fixed a bug in dist.ml (thanks to Emmanuel)

    o fixed a bug introduced to SH.test in 0.99-5

OTHER CHANGES

    o fixed several spelling mistakes in the documentation



        CHANGES IN PHANGORN VERSION 0.99-5


NEW FEATURES

    o parallel computing via multicore

      (so far bootstrap.pml, bootstrap.pml profit under linux)

    o compute edge weights for parsimony trees

BUG FIXES

    o optim.pml had problems when

    o as.character converted ?,- wrongly to NA

    o fitch needed binary trees as input, otherwise pscore is

      likely to be wrong (returns now a warning)

    o optim.pml had a problem with identical sequences

OTHER CHANGES

    o optim.parsimony returns now a tree with edge weights

    o vignette is enhanced, I fixed some spelling mistakes and added

      some more examples.



        CHANGES IN PHANGORN VERSION 0.99-4


NEW FEATURES

    o new generic function unique.phyDat

OTHER CHANGES

    o internal data format phyDat changed

      and data are stored more memory efficient

      (optim.pml and friends use less memory and may be faster)



		CHANGES IN PHANGORN VERSION 0.99-3


BUG FIXES

    o RF.dist sometimes returned wrong distances

    o rate parameter is now properly normalized in pml.Part

      and pmlCluster

    o simSeq had problems simulating a single character

NEW FEATURES

    o rSPR and rNNI to simulate tree rearrangements



		CHANGES IN PHANGORN VERSION 0.99-2


NEW FEATURES

    o bootstrap.pml and bootstrap.phyDat: parametric

      bootstrap methods

    o simSeq: A new function to simulate sequence data

    o read.phyDat: simplifies reading in alignments

    o SH.test: Shimodaira-Hasegawa test

    o RF.dist: Robinson-Foulds distance as replacement

      for treedist (uses less memory and is much faster)

BUG FIXES

    o dist.ml returned wrong variances.

    o as.character.phyDat, as.data.frame caused an error

      for alignments with only one site.

OTHER CHANGES

    o added vignette describing how to perform some

      standard phylogenetic analysis with phangorn.

    o more functions to convert between different data formats.

    o NNI tree search is now general possible for

      partition models (pmlPart, pmlCluster)



		CHANGES IN PHANGORN VERSION 0.0-5


BUG FIXES

    o Solved a namespace problem with ape (>=2.2-3).



		CHANGES IN PHANGORN VERSION 0.0-4


NEW FEATURES

    o splitsNetwork fits a phylogenetic network using a L1 penalty.

      (High memory consumption)

    o pmlPen: A new function to estimate penalized likelihood models

      for sets of edge weights in mixtures or partition models.

BUG FIXES

    o dist.ml should be more forgiving for different inputs.

OTHER CHANGES

    o a new dataset.




		CHANGES IN PHANGORN VERSION 0.0-3


NEW FEATURES

    o amino acid models

    o several new maximum likelihood models:

      mixture models (pmlMix), and some model for

      phylogenomic data partition models (pmlPart),

      and clustering of partitions / genes (pmlCluster)

      (still experimental, feed back wellcome)

    o design matrices for phylogenetic distance methods

    o added some functions useful for simulations

      (nni, allTrees)



OTHER CHANGES

    o the data object phyDat changed slightly internally

    o a new dataset

    o read.aa to read amino acid data in phylip format

      based on read.dna from the ape package





		CHANGES IN PHANGORN VERSION 0.0-2


NEW FEATURES

    o more generic functions (plot.pml, update.pml)


BUG FIXES

    o the "Fitch" algorithm in parsimony contained a bug


OTHER CHANGES

    o pml has a cleaner interface (less parameter)

    o new faster parsimony analysis (more compiled C-Code)

    o added NAMESPACE

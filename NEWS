      still experimental but useful for dating etc.

BUG FIXES

    o rNNI did return sometimes trees without tip labels 

    o SH.test did not work for pmlCluster objects

    o df for rooted rooted/ultrametric trees are correctly computed

OTHER CHANGES

    o lots of internal code C-code changed 

    o exports of some of the internal ML function, this should speed up in

      future other packages e.g. the colescentMCMC package, which use them

      considerably (interface may changes in the future)

    o registered C routines 



      CHANGES in PHANGORN VERSION 1.99-0

NEW FEATURES

    o new function dist.p to estimate pairwise polymorphism 

      p-distances from DNA sequences

    o fixed a bug that sometimes caused in pratched to crash

    o fixed a bug when using negative indices in subset.phyDat

    o the search heuristic SPR in optim.parsimony evaluates now more trees

      less memory reallocations and potentially time savings

      hopefully I included not too many bugs

      and will hopefully be more robust in the long term!

      and so are several functions depending on it, e.g. RF.dist, treedist, Descendants

\arguments{
\item{x}{An object of class \code{phyDat}}

\item{ratio}{Compute uncorrected ('p') distance or character difference.}

\item{exclude}{One of "none", "all", "pairwise" indicating whether to delete
the sites with gaps, missing data (or ambiguous states). See details below.}

\item{model}{One of "JC69", "F81" or one of 17 amino acid models see
details.}

\item{bf}{A vector of base frequencies.}

\item{Q}{A vector containing the lower triangular part of the rate matrix.}

\item{k}{Number of intervals of the discrete gamma distribution.}

\item{shape}{Shape parameter of the gamma distribution.}

\value{
an object of class \code{dist}

\description{
\code{dist.hamming}, \code{dist.ml} and \code{dist.logDet} compute pairwise
distances for an object of class \code{phyDat}. \code{dist.ml} uses DNA /
AA sequences to compute distances under different substitution models.
}
\details{
So far 17 amino acid models are supported ("WAG", "JTT", "LG", "Dayhoff",
"cpREV", "mtmam", "mtArt", "MtZoa", "mtREV24", "VT","RtREV", "HIVw", "HIVb",
"FLU", "Blosum62", "Dayhoff_DCMut" and "JTT_DCMut") and additional rate
matrices and frequencies can be supplied.

The "F81" model uses empirical base frequencies, the "JC69" equal base
frequencies. This is even the case if the data are not nucleotides.

The argument \code{exclude} decides how gaps / ambiguous data / missing data
are treated. Usually gaps are treated as ambiguous states, but you can give
gaps its on state \code{\link{gap_as_state}}. \code{exclude="none"} keeps all
ambiguous data. The behavior of \code{dist.ml} is in this case these same
you would achieve using \code{optim.pml} to compute pairwise distances, it
might be a bit odd. \code{exclude="all"} removes all sites with ambiguous
states and all gaps if these are coded as ambiguous states. This can lead to
the situation that there only few sites if any fo the alignment left.
Safer is therefore to use \code{exclude="pairwise"} which only removes sites
which are ambiguous for each pair of sequences.
